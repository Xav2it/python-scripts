We propose a python script that automates a call to the NCFX Forward Curve API, and to the prevailing spot and standard tenors API, to allow comparison between the granular forwards365 values and straightline interpolation between standard tenors.
We construct outrights for both methods and compare the differences in USD terms based on trading 1 million base (EUR)
I will amend this shortly so that we convert all notional to USD to allow comparability between currency pairs
